# Worblehat

## What?

Worblehat is a simple library management system written specifically for Programvareverkstedet.

## Why?

Programvareverkstedet is a small community with many books and games. A simple web platform is needed to manage the library. We need to know who owns each item, if we can loan it out and where it is.

Programvareverkstedet har en rekke b√∏ker, og en konstant tilstr√∏m av nye.
Teoretisk sett skal disse ryddes og kategoriseres jevntlig, men da dette ikke gj√∏res ofte nok kan det v√¶re et varig strev √• finne ut hvor b√∏ker st√•r til enhver tid.
Styret har derfor tatt initiativ til √• opprette et biblioteksystem for √• systematisere b√∏kene.
Prosjektet har f√•tt navn Worblehat etter en bibliotekar i Terry Pratchetts discworld serie.
Worblehatt har v√¶rt p√•begynnt flere ganger opp gjennom historien uten √• komme i noen form for funksjonell tilstand enda.

# Technical details

## Setup

This project uses [poetry][poetry] as its buildtool as of May 2023.

```console
$ poetry install
$ poetry run alembic migrate
$ poetry run worblehat --help
```

## How to configure

See `config.template` for configurable settings.

Unless provided through the `--config` flag, program will automatically look for a config file in these locations:

- `./config.toml`
- `~/.config/worblehat/config.toml`
- `/var/lib/worblehat/config.toml`

Run `poetry run worblehat --help` for more info

## Points of discussion

- Should this project run in a separate tty-instance on Dibblers interface, or should they share the tty with some kind of switching ability?
After some discussion with other PVV members, we came up with an idea where we run the programs in separate ttys, and use a set of large mechanical switches connected to a QMK-flashed microcontroller to switch between them.

- Workaround for not being able to represent items with same ISBN and different owner: if you are absolutely adamant about placing your item at PVV while still owning it, even though PVV already owns a copy of this item, please print out a new label with a "PVV-ISBN" for it
